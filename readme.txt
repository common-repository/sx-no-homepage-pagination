== Description ==

SX No Homepage Pagination removes properly any homepage pagination (whatever plugin or function you are using) and redirects useless paginated content.

You have to be carefull : if you don't see pagination links on your homepage, it does not always mean that WordPress isn't adding it in the HTML header.

This plugin works on any default homepage.

This SEO enhancement is not yet included in our <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-key/">**SEOKEY plugin**</a>. This optimization will be added in the near future, in addition to SEOKEY's many automatic SEO optimizations!
